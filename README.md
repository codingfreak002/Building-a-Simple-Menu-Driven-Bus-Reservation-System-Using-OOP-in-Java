# Building-a-Simple-Menu-Driven-Bus-Reservation-System-Using-OOP-in-Java
This project involves developing a Simple Menu-Driven Bus Reservation System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. The primary objective is to create a text-based interface that allows users to perform key operations such as adding bus records, viewing all available buses, checking seat availability, and reserving seats.
Key Features:
Bus Management: Users can insert new bus records into the system, each with a unique identifier, name, and seating capacity.
Reservation System: The system allows users to reserve seats on any bus, with real-time updates on seat availability.
User Interaction: The menu-driven interface ensures ease of navigation, enabling users to interact with the system effectively.
Data Encapsulation: The system leverages OOP principles, encapsulating data within classes like Bus and BusReservationSystem to ensure data integrity.
Polymorphism and Inheritance: The design includes polymorphic behaviors and inheritance to manage various bus types and reservation actions.
